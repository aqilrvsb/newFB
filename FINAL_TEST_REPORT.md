## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is NOT with:
- ✅ Your authentication (you have a valid token)
- ✅ Your session (it's active and valid)
- ✅ Your User ID (correctly configured)
- ✅ The server deployment (Laravel endpoints work)

The issue IS with:
- ❌ Facebook SDK initialization on the server
- ❌ The helper function `ensureFacebookSDKInitialized` may not be working as expected
- ❌ The SDK might be throwing an error that's being caught but not properly reported

## Recommended Fix

The server needs to:
1. Log the actual Facebook SDK errors instead of swallowing them
2. Ensure the Facebook access token from your session is being passed correctly to the SDK
3. Check if the SDK version (v23.0.0) is compatible with the server environment

## Next Steps

1. Check Railway logs for any Facebook SDK initialization errors
2. Add more detailed error logging to the server
3. Verify the Facebook access token is being stored and retrieved correctly from the session
