6. **check_ad_id**
   - Error: "Error checking ad ID: The request was made but no response was received"

## Pattern Analysis

The error "The request was made but no response was received" appears consistently across multiple tools. This suggests:

1. **Common Issue**: All failing tools share a similar implementation pattern that's causing the SDK to fail
2. **SDK Initialization**: The SDK might not be properly initialized for these specific methods
3. **Async/Await Issues**: There might be promise handling issues in these implementations

## Root Cause

The issue appears to be that these tools are not properly handling the Facebook SDK's response format or are missing proper error handling for the SDK calls.

## Fix Strategy

1. Apply the same fix pattern used for `get_ad_accounts` to all failing tools
2. Ensure proper SDK initialization before each call
3. Add better error handling for SDK-specific errors
4. Handle the Facebook SDK's cursor-based pagination properly
