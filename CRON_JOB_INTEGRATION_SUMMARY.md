# Cron Job Tools Integration Summary

## Date: June 18, 2025

### What Was Done:

1. **Created cron-job-tools.ts** - A complete TypeScript module for managing cron jobs via cron-job.org API
   - 7 tools for complete cron job management
   - Supports scheduling, updating, deleting, and monitoring cron jobs
   - Uses Malaysia timezone (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur) by default

2. **Fixed Syntax Errors** - The initial add_cron_job_tools.js script had corrupted the http-server.ts file
   - Restored from backup
   - Added tools cleanly without corruption
   - Successfully compiled with TypeScript

3. **Added All Missing Tools** - The backup was missing lead tracking tools, so we added:
   - check_ad_id
   - get_leads_data  
   - get_leads_with_insights
   - All 7 cron job tools

### Cron Job Tools Added:

1. **create_cron_job** - Create scheduled jobs with custom timing
2. **get_cron_job_details** - Get details of a specific cron job
3. **update_cron_job** - Update existing cron job settings
4. **delete_cron_job** - Delete a cron job
5. **get_cron_job_history** - View execution history
6. **get_cron_job_history_details** - Get specific execution details
7. **list_cron_jobs** - List all cron jobs in account

### Technical Details:

- All tools require API key from cron-job.org
- Default timezone: Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
- Supports various scheduling options (hours, minutes, days, etc.)
- Can handle GET/POST requests with custom headers and data

### Deployment:

- Successfully built with `npm run build`
- Deployed to Railway via GitHub
- Total tools now: 77 (67 Facebook + 3 Lead Tracking + 7 Cron Job)

### Usage Example:

```javascript
// Create a cron job
create_cron_job({
  apiKey: "your-cron-job-org-api-key",
  title: "Daily Report",
  url: "https://yourapp.com/api/daily-report",
  schedule: {
    hours: [9], // Run at 9 AM
    minutes: [0] // At 0 minutes
  },
  requestMethod: 0 // GET request
})
```

### Files Modified:

1. src/http-server.ts - Added tools and handlers
2. src/tools/cron-job-tools.ts - New file with all cron job functionality
3. README.md - Updated with cron job tools section

### Next Steps:

Users can now use the cron job tools in Claude Desktop by:
1. Getting their cron-job.org API key
2. Using any of the 7 cron job tools with the API key parameter
3. Managing scheduled tasks directly from Claude
